# Long-term goals of our research program
- Understand the molecular basis of plant adaptation under stressful environmental conditions in both natural and agricultural settings via studying the functions and molecular evolutionary patterns of plant genes.
- Predict molecular, physiological, and morphological phenotypes under specific environmental, spatial, and temporal contexts to better understand how and why biological systems work through integration of multi-scale data using computational and data science approaches.

# Current research foci

## Evolution of genome contents

How did genome evolve and what were the drivers? These questions are prompted by the observations that plants tend to have younger duplicate genes compared to other species, mainly due to frequent whole genome duplications. Example publications in this area:
- A Plant Physiology review discussing [evolution of duplicate genes in plants](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27288366).
- An early PNAS paper documenting [the dramatic expansion of the receptor-like kinase family in plants](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11526204) that kickstarted the PI's interests in evolution.
- A Genome Biology & Evolution paper on [the factors influencing gene family size variation across species](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30239695).

## Stress response evolution
<img align="left" style="max-height: 150px; width: auto;" src="https://github.com/ShiuLab/ShiuLab.github.io/blob/master/images/research/research_expression_divergence.png"> 
Under stressful environment, the expression of hundreds to thousands of genes changes at once. This response is essential for setting up proper physiological and developmental programs in plants so they can survive in adverse environment. Thus, proper response to stress is likely under significant amount of selective pressure. Example publications:
- A Plant Physiology paper detailing [molecular evidence of functional decay in a transcription factor regulating stress response](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27522016).
- A Plant Cell paper on [the evolution of stress response between domesticated and wild tomato species](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29743197).

## Signal vs. noise
<img align="left" style="max-height: 150px; width: auto;" src="https://github.com/ShiuLab/ShiuLab.github.io/blob/master/images/research/research_function_activity.png">
With the adavanced in omics approaches, we can now measure biochemical activities from genomic regions with ease. Interestingly, it turns out that much of regions between known genes have measurable activities such as transcription. Is such activity noise or reflect some functionality of the region? Example publications:
- A Plant Physiology paper assessing [the pervasiveness of intergenic expresson in Arabidopsis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23132786).
- Two Molecular Biology & Evolution papers integrating multi-omics datasets with machine learning methods to identify functional region [in Arabidopsis thaliana](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29554332) and [in human genomes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28398576).

## Regulatory logic & systems biology
<img align="left" style="max-height: 150px; width: auto;" src="https://github.com/ShiuLab/ShiuLab.github.io/blob/master/images/research/research_cisreg.png"> 
We are interested in deciphering the cis-regulatory code, i.e., how cis-regulatory sequenecs work in concert with transcription factors to specify gene expression in conditionally, spatially, and temporally specific manner. Check out:
- Our PNAS paper analyzing stress expression data from Arabidopsis thaliana with systems biology approaches in [a comprehensive analysis of plant stress cis-regulatory code](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21849619).
- Our PLoS Comp Biol paper discussing [the utility and limitation in using expression data for identifying functionally related genes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27935950).

Genome size variation in major plant taxonomic groups.There are 2,500 fold differences in plant genome size, ranging from ~60 million bases in Genlisea margaretae, a carnivorous plant, to 150 billion bases in Paris japonica, the canopy plant. Unlike other eukaryotes, plants also tend to have younger new genes in gene families than other species. With the increasing ease in sequencing and assessing expression of the entire genome of any species, many parts of the genomes that are between known genes are now found to be expressed.

# Evolution of transcriptional response to stress
<img align="left" width="150" height="100" src="https://github.com/ShiuLab/ShiuLab.github.io/blob/master/images/research/research_cisreg.png"> 
Gain and loss of stress responses among duplicate genes.Under stressful environment, the expression of hundreds to thousands of genes changes at once. This response is essential for setting up proper physiological and developmental programs in plants so they can survive in adverse environment. Thus, proper response to stress is most likely under significant amount of selective pressure. 

Example publications:
- Our [Plant Physiology paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27522016) detailing molecular evidence of functional decay in a transcription factor regulating stress response.
- Our [Plant Cell paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29743197) on the evolution of stress response between domesticated and wild tomato species.

How is gene expression regulated under stress? Substantial knowledge has accumulated on how short DNA motifs, cis-regulatory elements, in the promoter regions are involved in controlling gene expression. We are interested in deciphering the cis-regulatory code, i.e., how cis-elements work in concert to specify gene expression in response to stress.

## Machine learning for predictive biology
<img align="left" style="max-height: 150px; width: auto;" src="https://github.com/ShiuLab/ShiuLab.github.io/blob/master/images/research/research_ml.png"> 
Biology has become a data-rich discipline with a rapid influx of heterogeneous data in a rapid pace. Novel ways in looking at these data have the potential to answer new questions, make high quality predictions of many biological phenomenons with machine learning models, and, from these predictive models, better understand the underlying mechanisms.
