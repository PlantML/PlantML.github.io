Inspired by the article [Ten Simple Rules for Building an Anti-Racist Research Lab](https://ecoevorxiv.org/4a9p8/?utm_source=Nature+Briefing&utm_campaign=72689b2f3c-briefing-dy-20200619&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_c9dfd39373-72689b2f3c-44323345), we, the members of the Shiu lab, commit to the following actions: 

#### 1. Discussion on anti-discrimination or related topics

We will [read relevant literatures on anti-discrimination practices](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16F8oSwMwGKZz8eWC7oW-f87WXHGIWjAZQASHiCPjK74/edit#gid=0) for monthly discussions with the goals to:
* Consider our perspectives
* Know when and how to speak up

#### 2. Establish a lab "DEI intermediary":

We will have lab members serving as intermediaries in six month rotations to:
* Act as a confidente of DEI-related complaints and feedback.
* Communicate with PI on DEI-related issues that need to be resolved.
* Moderate bi-annual evalution of mentoring practices in the lab.

#### 3. Publishing and grant writing with minority colleagues

We will actively:
* Identify minority colleagues with similar research interests
* Seek research collaborations with the ultimate goals of joint publications and proposals.

#### 4. Intentionally recruit minority students and staff

The PI as well as the lab members will:
* Identify minority applicants through graduate programs, summer research programs, meetings, and other venues.
* Conduct annual evaulation of recruitment practice in our lab.

#### 5. Advocate and support actions of minority colleagues

We will: 
* Support efforts to organize at the departmental and inter-departmental levels
* Advocate for diversity in leadership in science in our institution and beyond.

#### 6. Remind ourself why we are doing this

We will:
* Hold ourselves and the powerful accountable
* Not seek any payback or gratitude for anti-discriminatory practices.
