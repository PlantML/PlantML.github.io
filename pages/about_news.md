## 9/27/19: Christina defeneded her PhD

Christina today defended her PhD thesis titled __Interpretable machine laerning in plant genomes: studies in the complex relationship between genotype and phenotype__. The seminar was held in Plant Biology Lab 247 and was full! Christina's parents also attended her seminar. In the talk, Christina laid out the overarching Christina is now moving to Australia working in algorithm development in single cell genomics studies. All the best Christina!

## 9/24/19: Sahra and Christina's work on the regulatory mechanisms of cell-type stress response is published

Our story titled [__Cis-regulatory code for predicting plant cell-type transcriptional response to high salinity__](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31551359) is now published in Plant Physiology with Sahra and Christina as joint first authors. Using the root cell-type transcriptome data, Sahra and Christina identified cis-regulatory sequences likely specify cell-type response to high salinity stress. More importantly, machine learning models were built to ask how well the identified regulatory sequences can predict cell-type response. The findings not only advance our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of the plant spatial transcriptional response, but also suggest broad applicability of the approach to any species, particularly those with little or no trans regulatory data.

## 9/18/19: Christina's work on benchmarking genomic prediction algorithms is published

Chrisitina's paper on [__Benchmarking Parametric and Machine Learning Models for Genomic Prediction of Complex Traits__](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31533955) is published today in G3. This is a collaborative between our colleague Gustavo de los Compos, Chrisitna's internship mentors Andrew McCarren and Mark Roantree, and Emily Bolger a highly productive summer research student. Using data of 18 traits across six plant species with different marker densities and training population sizes, Christina spearheaded a comparison of the performance of six linear and six non-linear algorithms.  The findings highlight that simpler, linear algorithm can beat out more sophiscated machine learning approaches, and the importance of algorithm selection for the prediction of trait values.
